1. Use TypeScript for all new files and code changes.
2. Follow Next.js conventions for file structure and routing (e.g., use the /app directory).
3. Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling; do not write custom CSS unless necessary.
4. Use the `Image` component from `next/image` for images.
5. Use the Geist font family via next/font as configured in layout.tsx.
6. Ensure all code is linted and type-safe.
7. Do not modify configuration files (e.g., next.config.ts, postcss.config.mjs, eslint.config.mjs) unless explicitly requested.
